- write unit tests

- Cooking:
	- when I made Edit of cooking (amount of cuts), check what will happens with price (recalculated?)
	- problem with not showing expiration! fix it....
	- Edit: should have different view 
		- should be able to set up CUT (or make extra action in Cooking/Index view
		- problem with SaveChanges while editing, (some of the data are not loaded)

- Recipe:
	- Unit should be related to WarehouseItem, dont want to mix units between recipe and warehouse. Keep it simple (one unit per WarehouseItem)
		- it will be linked/related to WarehouseItem (Unit)
- Inventory function
	- create inventory function
	- main goal is to make list of all storage stuff with theoretical stock amount and write real amount. Show the differences in table after and update original theoretical amounts in stock.

- WarehouseItem
	- for batches, make some function for "throw away" almost empty or expired batches of material.
