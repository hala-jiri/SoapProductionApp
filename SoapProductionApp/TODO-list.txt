- write unit tests

- Cooking:
	- when I made Edit of cooking (amount of cuts), check what will happens with price (recalculated?)
	- problem with not showing expiration! fix it....
	- Edit: should have different view 
		- should be able to set up CUT (or make extra action in Cooking/Index view
		- problem with SaveChanges while editing, (some of the data are not loaded)
	- Create:
		- what will happen if user will push create new Recipe but we dont have enough stuff on stock?

- Recipe:
	- Unit should be related to WarehouseItem, dont want to mix units between recipe and warehouse. Keep it simple (one unit per WarehouseItem)
		- it will be linked/related to WarehouseItem (Unit)
