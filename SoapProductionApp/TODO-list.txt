- write unit tests

- Cooking:
	- problem with not showing expiration! fix it....
	- when we added pictures into Recipe and cooking, what will happen when we create cooking and it copy url of images from Recipe to Cooking. And when someone will decide to delete Recipe or delete picture/url in Recipe view? Will cooking lose pictures?		- how to solve it? 
			- Create copy of picture? many same pictures on server.
			- Link url from Recipe to Cooking? (when url in recipe change the url in cooking will change). But what if Recipe will be deleted?

	- Edit: should have different view 
		- should be able to set up CUT (or make extra action in Cooking/Index view
		- problem with SaveChanges while editing, (some of the data are not loaded)

- Recipe:
	- Unit should be related to WarehouseItem, dont want to mix units between recipe and warehouse. Keep it simple (one unit per WarehouseItem)
		- it will be linked/related to WarehouseItem (Unit)
- Inventory function
	- create inventory function
	- main goal is to make list of all storage stuff with theoretical stock amount and write real amount. Show the differences in table after and update original theoretical amounts in stock.

- WarehouseItem
	- for batches, make some function for "throw away" almost empty or expired batches of material.

UnitTests:
- CookingController
	- Problem with Edit, when data should not be editable. Maybe need to go over ViewModels in this controller method.
