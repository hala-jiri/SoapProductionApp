- write unit tests
- make a admin section with delete and filling database (for testing purposes)
- Cooking:
	- when I made Edit of cooking (amount of cuts), check what will happens with price (recalculated?)
	- problem with not showing expiration! fix it....
	- Edit: should have different view 
		- should not be able to change batch size or notes
		- should be able to set up CUT (or make extra action in Cooking/Index view
	- Create:
		- notes should be able in Create)

- Recipe:
	- Unit should be related to WarehouseItem, dont want to mix units between recipe and warehouse. Keep it simple (one unit per WarehouseItem)
		- it will be linked/related to WarehouseItem (Unit)

	- new recipe dont show units! (compare to edit which show units)
